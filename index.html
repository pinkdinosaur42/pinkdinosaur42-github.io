<h1>My First Heading</h1>

<p>take over the world<br>
<br>
top down processing, how can i have a really good generalization of something. <br>
<br>
a context umbrealla<br>
<br>
generations motives -> more general to specific<br>
but culture, -> more specific to general<br>
	when i say culture, i mean like language and art<br>
<br>
<br>
why?<br>
<br>
generational motives are about how we live out life and out motivations<br>
<br>
culture -> its about communication. i dont know why but back in the day, (is it about the<br> connection i want to connect to more people so i have to be more general.) but back in the day<br> you only knew like 4 people and then your communicaiton did have to be so general for all<br> people?? but now the goal is you can create something that a lot of people understand and<br> thats the goal. the more people understand the better. i think this includes words<br>

what kind of problems do you want to solve? i want to solve thing about the world<br>
<br>


<dl>
  <dt>i want to find a general rule for systems</dt>
  <dd>-> i want it to be like general -> specific or specific ->general</dd>
  <dd>-> i think its general -> to specific for certain systems like generational motivations,music learning, language learning, personal identity </dd>
  <dd>-> secific to general for like cultural things, like evolution,maybe these are actually all general to sepcific too like cultural, the cultureal things used to be like individual things, but as generations go by ,they become a large goup of things.
</dl>




		general = atoms and molecules<br>
		specific = as life goes on, there are more categories of things<br> like there is life and not life
			mammal and non mammal etc.
<br>
<br>
<dl>
  <dt>examples of system</dt>
  <dd>-> brain</dd>
  <dd>-> computer</dd>
  <dd>-> society</dl>

</dl>

<br>
<br>
the idea i want to capture is like when something becomes something. like i the paper crane<br> thing. like the paper crane is the context.
